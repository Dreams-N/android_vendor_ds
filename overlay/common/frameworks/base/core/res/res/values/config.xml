    <!-- Package name(s) containing location provider support.
          These packages can contain services implementing location providers,
          such as the Geocode Provider, Network Location Provider, and
          Fused Location Provider. They will each be searched for
          service components implementing these providers.
          It is strongly recommended that the packages explicitly named
          below are on the system image, so that they will not map to
          a 3rd party application.
          The location framework also has support for installation
          of new location providers at run-time. The new package does not
          have to be explicitly listed here, however it must have a signature
          that matches the signature of at least one package on this list.
